                <strong>Review:</strong> Literary success is filled with first time wonders, say an outstanding novel, followed by never-quite-as-good second, third or more works. 
                <br>Sally Rooney’s first two novels shattered this premise as they were both excellent. The third, alas, was not. Then comes this one, Intermezzo, and I picked it up with a bit of scepticism as promotional great reviews usually accompany the new releases of already established bestseller authors. Well, not only is this book on par with her first two, but it also reaches new heights as Rooney revisits already familiar elements of the lives of Irish millennials through a fascinating host of characters. This time she adds a more experimental prose to her already powerful arsenal of describing and narrating tools, resulting in a vivid, engaging, and compelling book. As the cliché goes, it is hard to put this one down.</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆ (4/5)</p>
